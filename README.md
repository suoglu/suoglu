- 👋 Hi, I am Yigit
- 👀 I’m interested in RTL design, embedded programming and scripting
- 👾 I mostly use Verilog and C++, sometimes Python and a little bit Bash
- 📫 How to reach me: yigit.suoglu@proton.me or suoglu@icloud.com
   - If you have a problem with your homework, please ask it to your instructor
      - I don't really have time to explain stuff to strangers and it is kind a their job
   - If there is an issue with one of the repositories or you want a feature to be added, please use issues
      - I think it is easier to keep track and more transparent
      - Or feel free to implement it yourself; much better as more people contribute!
   - Also open to collaborations in interesting open source projects
